In "NetDefender," you step into the shoes of a budding cybersecurity expert embarking on a thrilling journey through the world of digital defense. Your journey begins when you receive a prestigious offer to join CyberSpec, the leading cybersecurity firm in Finland, as an intern.

Excitement quickly turns to a baptism by fire as you're thrust into the heart of a high-stakes crisis. MediCorp Inc., a trusted provider of data management services for the medical and financial sectors, falls victim to a massive data breach. With your manager on vacation and unreachable, you're called upon by the head of IT to lead the investigation.

Armed with limited cybersecurity knowledge, you dive headfirst into the tangled web of the MediCorp breach. Each clue you unravel uncovers another layer of the mystery, and every decision you make could mean the difference between containment and catastrophe.

- Battle against phishing attacks while securing email communications.
- Fortify network defenses, configure firewalls, and implement VPNs.
